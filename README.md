Quantile Bounds for Multi-Armed Bandits
=======================================

We construct new algorithm for the multi-armed bandit problem.  For all
<b>&epsilon; &isin; (0,1)</b>, we prove a regret bound with respect to the
<b>(&epsilon; N)</b>-th best arm. This is a joint work of [Francesco
Orabona](http://francesco.orabona.com/) and [Dávid
Pál](http://david.palenica.com/).
